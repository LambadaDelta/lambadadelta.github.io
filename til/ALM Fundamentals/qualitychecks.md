# Baking in quality

put your acceptance upfront, before the developers see it.

> Testers need to test the business functionality not what the developer built

## Fast feedback

Allows you to improve code delivery

Failure provides purchase inforamtion

## Code Quality

> Devs should always care about whether their stuff works

Never let failing tests pass by. Pull out the unit test, and fix the issue or remove the test as it no longer applies.

Do not let code reviews build up.

>"Soapbox Theory"
>A colleague is working on something important, and you need to break them away for a code review. when in deep flow they should be left, but you need to be agressive on getting that time otherwise, reason being that the code you want them to review is further ahead than the piece he is working on, so has more imediate value.

>Stop starting, Start finishing

## DevTest / DevOps

Opposite sides of the same coin.

>Continuous requires delivery

People say they are doing Continuous Integration because a build kicks off, but have so many branches that are long lived you cannot really call it that.

A slow build / deploy is a smell, invest time to speed it up.
